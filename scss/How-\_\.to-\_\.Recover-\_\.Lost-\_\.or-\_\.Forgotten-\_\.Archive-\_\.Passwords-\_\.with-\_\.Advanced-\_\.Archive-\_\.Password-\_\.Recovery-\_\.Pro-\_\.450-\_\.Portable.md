As you can see, there are four tabs at the top: General, Dictionary, Brute-force, and Known-plaintext. Each tab corresponds to a different password recovery method that you can choose depending on your situation and preferences.
  
## Step 2: Select the Archive File and the Password Recovery Method
  
The next step is to select the archive file that you want to recover the password for. You can do this by clicking on the "Open" button at the top left corner and browsing to the location of the file on your computer or device.
  
After selecting the file, you will see some information about it on the right panel, such as the file name, size, type, compression method, encryption method, and password length (if known).
  
Then, you need to choose the password recovery method that suits your case best. There are four options:
  
- **General**: This is the default and fastest method that tries to recover the password using common settings and combinations. It works well for simple passwords that are not too long or complex.
- **Dictionary**: This method uses a list of words or phrases that are likely to be used as passwords. You can use the built-in dictionary or load your own custom dictionary file. This method is effective for passwords that are based on common words or names.
- **Brute-force**: This method tries every possible combination of characters until it finds the correct password. You can specify the character set, the minimum and maximum length, and other options to speed up the process. This method is guaranteed to find the password eventually, but it may take a long time depending on the complexity of the password.
- **Known-plaintext**: This method uses a part of the original file that you know or have access to as a clue to recover the password. For example, if you have another copy of the same file without password protection or if you know some text or data that is inside the archive file. This method can be very fast and accurate if you have enough plaintext information.

You can switch between the tabs and adjust the settings according to your needs. For example, if you choose the Dictionary method, you can select or load a dictionary file from the "Dictionary" section:

If you choose the Brute-force method, you can specify the character set and length range from the "Range" section:
